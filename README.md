# TI-83 Avalanche!

You are looking at my front end project for Quarter 1 at Galvanize. It's a game built in the spirit of the TI-83 calculator game Avalanche! 

This is the first game I have ever worked on, and I completed it in less than a week. I used HTML (HTML5 canvas), CSS, and JavaScript.

It's a simple game, but I think it's really fun to play, and I am proud that I was able to complete it in one week with essentially no previous programming experience (and absolutely none in HTML5 canvas).
